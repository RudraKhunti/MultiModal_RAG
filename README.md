# Multimodal RAG Workflow

This notebook implements a **Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline, enabling integration of multiple input types (e.g., text and images) to enhance retrieval-based generation tasks. The workflow combines data retrieval, preprocessing, and model inference, potentially involving multimodal embeddings.

## Features

- **Library Setup**: Includes essential imports for handling multimodal data, processing, and model interactions.
- **Data Loading**: Handles loading text, image, or other multimodal data sources for retrieval tasks.
- **Processing Pipeline**: Preprocesses data, extracts features, and applies retrieval mechanisms.
- **Model Inference**: Demonstrates the use of a generative model augmented with retrieval capabilities.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Necessary Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt` or within the notebook)
- GPU recommended for faster inference with large models

## How to Use

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure you have all required libraries installed.
2. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells sequentially for the complete pipeline.
3. **Customize**: Modify the data loading and preprocessing sections to adapt to your dataset.

## Outputs

- Generated responses based on multimodal queries.
- Visualizations or logs demonstrating retrieval and generation steps.

## Potential Applications

- Multimodal question answering
- Image-caption generation augmented by retrieval
- Context-aware generative tasks

**Note:** Ensure proper setup of dependencies and hardware for efficient execution.
